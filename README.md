## Introduction

Logistic regression is a commonly used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark, provides powerful capabilities for distributed computing and machine learning, making it suitable for implementing logistic regression on large-scale datasets.

This repository provides hands-on examples and tutorials to help you learn and understand how to implement logistic regression using PySpark. Whether you're new to PySpark or looking to deepen your understanding of logistic regression, you'll find practical examples and code snippets to guide you through the process.

## Setup

To run the code examples in this repository, you'll need to have Python and Apache Spark installed on your system. You can install PySpark using pip:

bash
pip install pyspark
Additionally, make sure you have a compatible version of Java installed on your system, as Apache Spark requires Java to run.

Usage
You can find the code examples and tutorials in the examples directory. Each example demonstrates a different aspect of implementing logistic regression using PySpark, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

To run an example, navigate to its directory and execute the Python script using spark-submit. For example:

bash
Copy code
spark-submit logistic_regression_example_pyspark.py
Follow the instructions within each example to understand the code and experiment with different parameters and settings.

Examples
binary_classification_example.py: Demonstrates binary classification using logistic regression with PySpark.
multiclass_classification_example.py: Demonstrates multiclass classification using logistic regression with PySpark.
